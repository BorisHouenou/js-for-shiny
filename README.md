## Overview

Shiny gives users a powerful toolkit to create interactive web applications. As a result, Shiny users are also web developers! Inevitably, an intermediate Shiny user will want to create a visualization or user interface that isn't available in the `shiny` package. Fortunately, we can use the building blocks of the web -- JavaScript, HTML, and CSS -- to extend Shiny's capabilities and create engaging Shiny apps.

This two-day, hands-on workshop will introduce Shiny users to JavaScript, the ubiquitous scripting language that powers the modern web. We will explore JavaScript's syntax and will discover its functional programming style to be refreshingly familiar to tidyverse R users. We will learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and how Shiny uses JavaScript to communicate between the browser and Shiny server. Together, we will build an `htmlwidget` and as we learn how to incorporate our own or packaged JavaScript code into Shiny apps and RMarkdown documents, and how to simultaneously manage JavaScript and R dependencies.

## Learning objectives

Attendees will learn basic JavaScript and how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS in interactive webpages. We will explore how to use JavaScript effectively in Shiny apps using htmlwidgets and htmltools. We delve into how Shiny uses JavaScript to build engaging Shiny apps.

## Is this course for me?

This workshop is for the Shiny user who boldly waded into the *Customizing Shiny* section of shiny.rstudio.com/articles and quickly wished they had more experience with JavaScript. This user recognizes the benefits of learning JavaScript, but she is overwhelmed by the sheer number of packages, tutorials, and StackOverflow questions that exist in the world. The goal of this workshop is to meet the Shiny user where they are now to learn the best parts of JavaScript that will provide the most value and facilitate learning and exploration after the workshop.

## Prework

:woman_technologist: Please follow the instructions in [setup.md](setup.md) to get started.

We will spend most of our time in this workshop in RStudio and a web browser. [RStudio Desktop][rstudio-desktop] is preferred because we will occasionally need to run commands like `npm` in your computer's terminal or console.

I recommend the [Firefox], [Firefox Developer Edition][firefox-dev], or [Chrome] browsers and will use Firefox during the workshop.
